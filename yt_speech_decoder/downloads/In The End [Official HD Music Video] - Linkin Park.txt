 1. I don't know why It doesn't even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind, I'm designed as product to explain and do time All I know, time is a valuable thing Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings Watch it count down to the end of the day The clock takes life away, so unreal Didn't look ever low, watch the time go right out the window Trying to hold on, didn't even know Or wasted at all just to watch you go I kept everything inside and even though I tried It all fell apart, what it meant to be Will eventually be a memory of a time I tried so hard and got so far But in the end, it doesn't even matter I had too far to lose it all But in the end, it doesn't even matter One thing, I don't know why It doesn't even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme to remind myself Somehow I tried so hard In spite of the way you were mocking me Acting like I was part of your property Remembering all the times you've fought with me I'm surprised they got so things aren't the way they were before You wouldn't even recognize me anymore Not that you knew me back then But it all comes back to me in the end You kept everything inside and even though I tried It all fell apart, what it meant to me Will eventually be a memory of a time I tried so hard and got so far But in the end, it doesn't even matter I had too far to lose it all But in the end, it doesn't even matter I put that trust in you Just as far as I can go For all this There's only one thing you should know I've put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go For all this There's only one thing you should know I tried so hard and got so far But in the end, it doesn't even matter I had too far to lose it all But in the end, it doesn't even matter I tried so hard and got so far But in the end, it doesn't even matter
